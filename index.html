                  <!-- My first experience with web design came from a need for a site developed for work, with no hours to invest in training or a budget for software. -->
                  My first experience in designing a full site: I was working at an event company in their creative department and trying to find a way to share all new event themes, entertainment options and amentities with our event managers spread across the US. Wix allowed me to choose a blank page and build from there.  Responsible for all aspects from copy, content, blog posts and photography, I was thrown in the deep end with floaties on.  Wix guided me by not requiring me to learn code, but gave me the freedom to create exactly what we needed.

By having a platform to consistently write to, I am able to strenthen my writing chops as well as share positive personal stories on reflection, mindfulness and perspective.

         <h3>A Little About Me...</h3>
         <p>   My name is Kim.  I'm a Mountain View, California girl living the Colorado lifestyle in beautiful Fort Collins.  A recent Front End Bootcamp grad, I am making a career transition to web design and couldn't be more eager to keep advancing my skills.  My first experience with web design was back in the day on MySpace, styling my profile every few weeks. If I knew then that was something that could have led down this career path sooner I wouldn't have believed you.</p>

         <p>   I'm passionate about the small things. The tiny details that make something more elegant or clean.  The invisible designs that wow you and enhance your experience rather than distract and detract.  My strengths are UX/UI web design, mockup production, presentations and copy writing/content creation.  My goal is to find an internship with a great team, that is always pushing for the best. I learn through experience, and reptetition.  Throw me in the deep end with the team and I will figure it out. </p>

         <p>
            When not working, you will find me in the mountains, on the bike path, in my workshop or binging a good show along side my pug Yoshi and my partner, Jeff.
